          <h3>Learn Web Development in the easiest way</h3>
          <p>
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
            Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
            development can range from developing a simple single static page of
            plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
            social network services.
            <br /><br />
            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can
            consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard
            methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
            developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as
            a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
            development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather
            than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of
            Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end
            developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are
            responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
            while back-end developers deal with the servers.Since the
            commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become
            one of the most used technologies ever.
            <br /><br />
            In any web project, the testing phase is incredibly intricate and
            difficult. Because web apps are frequently designed for a diverse
            and often unknown user base running in a range of technological
            environments, their complexity exceeds that of traditional
            Information Systems (IS). To ensure maximum reach and efficacy, the
            website must be tested in a variety of contexts and technologies.
            The website moves to the delivery stage after gaining final approval
            from the designer. To ensure its preparation for launch, the quality
            assurance team performs rigorous testing for functionality,
            compatibility, and performance. Additional testing is carried out,
            including integration, stress, scalability, load, resolution, and
            cross-browser compatibility. When the approval is given, the website
            is pushed to the server via FTP, completing the development
            process.<br /><br />
            During this critical stage, the website is built while keeping its
            fundamental goal in mind, paying close attention to all graphic
            components to assure the establishment of a completely working site.
            The procedure begins with the development of the main page, which is
            followed by the production of interior pages. The site's
            navigational structure is being refined in particular. During this
            development phase, key functionality such as the Content Management
            System, interactive contact forms, and shopping carts are activated.
            The coding process includes creating all of the site's software and
            installing it on the appropriate Web servers. This can range from
            simple things like posting to a Web server to more complex tasks
            like establishing database connections.
